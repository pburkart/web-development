# HTML Example Guide

This document contains some brief information for each of the example HTML documents in this repository. All of these examples more or less have the exact same structure. We specify the version of HTML we're using with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag, then we set a title, and add just a little bit of styling. You don't have to worry too much about the style portion of this yet, but all it does is center all text within the `body` so that everything remains centered. 

## Headings 

In this document you will find 6 sets of tags within the body. The first set being `<h1></h1>` and the last being `<h6></h6>`. The `<h1></h1>` header is the largest, and the `<h6></h6>` header is the smallest. Typically these are used in descending order with the main title of the page being an `<h1>` and then the various subsections being `<h2>`, `<h3>`, ..., `<h6>` depending on how many nested subsections there are. 

## Links

In this document you will only find two links. You will find one external link pointing towards Google, and one internal link pointing towards the headings.html file. When you specify a filename without a domain before it, the browser automatically assumes you're referencing an internal file residing within the same directory. If we were to specify the link as ../headings.html, it would try and find the headings.html file in the /Examples directory rather than the /HTML directory.
